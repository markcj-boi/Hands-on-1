    <h1>My First Web Page</h1>
    <h3>Headings Are Great Fun</h3>

    <p>This is my first <b>paragraph</b>in my new webpage. This is going to be 
    great. I am so excited I can hardly contain <b>myself</b>. Don't you just love
    paragraphs? I find them very useful.</p>

    <h3>Web Pages Are Exciting Too</h3>
    <p>Yes, that's right-web pages can be a lot of fun. Learning how to create
    web pages is easy and <b>entertaining</b>. This is my second paragraph. I
    hope you like it.</p>
